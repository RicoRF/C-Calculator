# C# Calculator Project

## Project Overview

This project is a fully functional calculator application developed as part of an educational exercise to demonstrate proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#. It serves as a practical implementation of core programming concepts and design principles while adhering to modular and maintainable code practices.

## Features

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Validates user input to prevent invalid operations, such as division by zero.
   - Displays user-friendly error messages for invalid operations or inputs.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

4. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - Implements core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

5. **Testing Suite**:
   - Includes unit tests to validate the functionality of calculator operations and ensure code reliability.
